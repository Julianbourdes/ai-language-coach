## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

   ```bash
   # Install pnpm if you don't have it
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

2. **Docker** (for PostgreSQL database)
   ```bash
   # macOS: Download Docker Desktop from docker.com
   # Linux: Install via package manager
   # Windows: Download Docker Desktop from docker.com
   ```

3. **Ollama** (for local AI)
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install ollama

   # Linux
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

   # Windows: Download from https://ollama.com/download
   ```

4. **Whisper** (for speech-to-text)
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install whisper-cpp

   # Linux: Build from source
   # https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp

   # Or use Python whisper
   pip install openai-whisper
   ```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Set Up PostgreSQL & Redis (Required for auth)

```bash
# Using Docker (recommended)
docker compose up -d

# Initialize database
pnpm db:migrate
```

This will start both PostgreSQL (for user data) and Redis (for sessions). See [SETUP-DB.md](./SETUP-DB.md) for detailed instructions and alternatives.

### 3. Set Up Ollama

```bash
# Pull the language model (this may take a few minutes)
ollama pull llama3.1:8b

# Start Ollama server (keep this running)
ollama serve
```

### 4. Configure Environment

The `.env.local` file is already configured with defaults:

```
# Database & Cache
POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://languagecoach:local_dev_password@localhost:5432/languagecoach
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Ollama
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1:8b

# Whisper
WHISPER_MODEL=small
WHISPER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=/usr/local/bin/whisper
```

Update the `WHISPER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` if needed based on your installation.

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/coach](http://localhost:3000/coach) in your browser.
